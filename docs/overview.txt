BACKSTORY:
  The year is 20XX.

  You are a lion that, for reasons unknown, has been shipped to the top floor of an executive office building in downtown Capitol City, USA. In your heart beats a longing for the African Savannah. Instead, you find yourself in a modern office building, fluorescent lights have replaced the warm sun above, and terrible team-building posters have taken the place of the dry trees that dot your normal landscape.

  You are confused, hungry, and angry.

  And now, you must escape.


MECHANICS:

  The game is a side scroller, played as the lion. The objective is to get through each level, which is a floor in the build. You navigate through each level, until you reach the main lobby.

  Cardinal Rules
    - no blood
    - realism is only used for humor
    - the game is purposely absurd
    - you can finish the game without attacking anyone. In this case, the game becomes almost an absurd walking simulator.
