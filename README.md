# Office Lion: The Game

The year is 20XX. The scenario: there's a lion in an office building. It's not natural, for the office _or_ the lion. And yet, here we are.

**You** are the lion. One minute you were in a redneck's sanctuary compound eating expired meat from Ingles, the next you're in a fancy highrise corporate office space, surrouned by generic corporate artwork, motivational posters and flourescent lighting.

And now, it's time to clock out for the day and get back to something _more_ normal - maybe not "home", but not here.

### Rules

* Generally rated PG, or whatever the equivalent is in Games. Pegi 9? I dunno. In Europe they have those prerolls with the deep voiced British guy that says "PEGI" something. So, that.
* No blood
* No cursing - I *just* said PG.
* Realism is only used for humor
* The game is purposely absurd
* You can finish the game without attacking anyone. In this case, the game becomes almost an absurd walking simulator.

### Mechanics

* Track office damage, points for destruction of the most offensive office elements, like water features and standing desks
* Dialogue trees, only every option the Lion has is a growl or a roar, or maybe a confused "errr?"

### End Game Goals

* **Knock out everyone:**
  The building crumbles down, you've emptied it's soul and the people in it.
* **Don't knock out anyone**
  Voted Employee of the Month. You get a placard and everything, and get featured in corporate newsletter.

This is entirely a lark to learn Godot and the process of creating a game. I'm totally comfortable working a graphics editor, getting the hang of pixel art, and I can code just dandy. Now it's a long process of navigating a game framework like Godot.
